# About the project

*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your github repository here. This is an R markdown (.Rmd) file so you can use R markdown syntax. See the 'Useful links' page in the mooc area (chapter 1) for instructions.*

The instructor of my doctoral thesis (in sosiology) advised me to participate in this IODS course. The point for me ist to learn R, but it seems that also GitHub has to be learned. So far I am totally unfamiliar with both of them.

Installation of R, RStudio and GitHub is done.
